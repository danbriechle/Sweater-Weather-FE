# Sweater Weather FronEnd 

<https://danbriechle.github.io/Sweater-Weather-FE>.
This is the front end portion of Sweater Weather. A mod 3 and mod 4 project at Turing School of Software and Design. The mod 3
Portion is a backend API that provides weather data for consumption based upon city and state searches. More info is available 
in here <https://github.com/danbriechle/Sweater-Weather>. This portion of the project consumes the back end API using Jquery,
and displays relevant weather data.

City weather data is searchable via the input field. This call also generates a new backround image based upon the location.

# Known Issues 

Currently the incrementing clock built with Jquery is intermitently functioning. It increments the time based upon the
users current location not the location searched.

# Future Iterations 

Adding searched location time generation 
Creating the ability for users to have a profile and favorite locations
